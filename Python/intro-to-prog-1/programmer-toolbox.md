### From ChatGPT:

### Prompt: "explain what are the tools used by programmers to non-programmers in a introduction to programming course"

Sure! Here's an explanation of the tools used by programmers, tailored for non-programmers in an introduction to programming course:

1. **Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** 
   - A text editor is a software tool used by programmers to write and edit code. It provides features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and indentation to make coding easier.
   - An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a more comprehensive software suite that includes a text editor, compiler or interpreter, debugger, and other tools for software development.
   - Examples of text editors: Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text.
   - Examples of IDEs: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, PyCharm.

2. **Version Control Systems (VCS):**
   - Version Control Systems are tools used to track changes to code files over time, allowing multiple programmers to collaborate on a project and manage revisions.
   - They provide features like branching, merging, and rollback to help teams manage code changes effectively.
   - Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial.

3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI) or Terminal:**
   - The command-line interface is a text-based interface used to interact with the computer's operating system using commands typed into a terminal window.
   - Programmers use the command line to run programs, navigate file directories, and perform various tasks related to software development.
   - Examples: Command Prompt (Windows), Terminal (Mac/Linux).

4. **Web Browser:**
   - Web browsers are used by programmers to test and debug web applications, view documentation and tutorials, and access online resources related to programming.
   - They are also used to preview and interact with web pages and web-based applications during development.
   - Examples: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge.

5. **Debugging Tools:**
   - Debugging tools help programmers identify and fix errors, or "bugs," in their code.
   - They provide features like breakpoints, variable inspection, and step-by-step execution to help diagnose and troubleshoot problems.
   - Examples: Chrome DevTools, Visual Studio Debugger, PyCharm Debugger.

6. **Package Managers:**
   - Package managers are tools used to install, manage, and update software libraries and dependencies used in a project.
   - They automate the process of downloading and installing packages from online repositories, making it easier to integrate third-party code into projects.
   - Examples: npm (Node.js), pip (Python), Composer (PHP).

7. **Documentation and Online Resources:**
   - Programmers often rely on documentation and online resources to learn about programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, as well as to troubleshoot problems and find solutions to coding challenges.
   - Examples: Official language documentation (e.g., Python documentation), tutorial websites (e.g., W3Schools, MDN Web Docs), programming forums (e.g., Stack Overflow).

These are some of the essential tools used by programmers to write, debug, and manage software projects. Familiarizing oneself with these tools is an important step in learning how to program effectively.

### Prompt: "provide a simple exercise to introduce vs code to non-programmers"


Certainly! Here's a simple exercise to introduce Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to non-programmers:

Exercise: Introduction to Visual Studio Code

Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to introduce non-programmers to the basic features and functionality of Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Materials Needed:
- Computers with Visual Studio Code installed
- Sample text file or simple code file

Procedure:
1. Introduction:
   - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a text editor developed by Microsoft that is widely used by programmers for writing and editing code.
   - While VS Code is primarily used for programming, it can also be useful for editing text files, taking notes, and other general-purpose tasks.

2. Opening Visual Studio Code:
   - Open Visual Studio Code on your computer. Search for "Visual Studio Code" in the Start menu or applications folder.

3. Exploring the Interface:
   - Once VS Code is open, explore the main components of the interface, including:
     - The sidebar: Displays file explorer, search, and source control options.
     - The editor: Where code or text is displayed and edited.
     - The status bar: Provides information about the current file, language mode, and other settings.
   - Click around and explore the interface on your own.

4. Opening a Sample File:
   - Provide participants with a sample text file or simple code file to open in Visual Studio Code. This could be a plain text file with some sample text or a basic code file in a programming language like HTML, JavaScript, or Python.
   - Have participants open the file in VS Code and observe how it is displayed in the editor.

5. Editing and Formatting Text:
   - Demonstrate how to edit and format text in Visual Studio Code, including:
     - Typing and deleting text.
     - Selecting text.
     - Using keyboard shortcuts for common editing tasks (e.g., Ctrl + S to save, Ctrl + Z to undo).
     - Formatting options for code files (e.g., auto-indentation, formatting code with the built-in formatter).

6. Saving and Closing Files:
   - Show participants how to save changes to a file in Visual Studio Code by clicking File > Save or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + S.
   - Demonstrate how to close a file or exit Visual Studio Code when finished.

7. Conclusion:
   - Summarize the key points covered in the exercise and ask participants if they have any questions or feedback about Visual Studio Code.
   - Encourage participants to continue exploring Visual Studio Code on their own and experiment with its features.

By following this exercise, non-programmers can gain a basic understanding of Visual Studio Code and its functionality, setting the stage for further exploration and learning.


## Git and GitHub

### Prompt: "explain to non-programmers what git and github are"


Sure! Here's an explanation of what Git and GitHub are, simplified for non-programmers:

1. **Git:**
   - Git is a version control system used by programmers to manage changes to their code.
   - Think of Git as a tool that keeps track of every change you make to your code, allowing you to go back to previous versions if needed.
   - It's like having a time machine for your code, where you can rewind to any point in time to see what your code looked like at that moment.
   - Git helps programmers collaborate on projects by providing a way to merge changes made by multiple people without conflicts.
   - It's widely used in software development to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain the integrity of code projects.

2. **GitHub:**
   - GitHub is a platform built on top of Git that provides a place for programmers to store their code and collaborate with others.
   - Think of GitHub as a social network for code, where developers can share their projects, contribute to open-source software, and collaborate on coding projects.
   - It allows programmers to host their Git repositories online, making it easy to access and share code with others.
   - GitHub provides additional features like issue tracking, project management tools, and code review features to facilitate collaboration and communication among developers.
   - Many companies and open-source projects use GitHub to manage their code repositories and collaborate with contributors from around the world.

In summary, Git is a version control system that helps programmers manage changes to their code, while GitHub is a platform built on top of Git that provides a place for programmers to store and share their code with others. Together, they form an essential part of the toolkit for software development and collaboration.
